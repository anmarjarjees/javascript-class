        ********************************************************************************
        Task/Lab for you (in-class):
        ********************************************************************************

        Task for you:
        1- Ask (prompt) the user whether they want to convert kg to lb or lb to kg
           they can:
           > Input 1 for converting kg to lb 
           > Input 2 for converting lb to kg
        
        For example, you can display this text in the first prompt() function:
        "Input 1 for converting kg to lb, or input 2 for converting lb to kg"

        The user needs to respect the input or pay attention to the value is going to enter:
        the value should be 1 or 2 only
    	
        Option that you can add:
        =======================
        Add validation: The user has to choose either 1 or 2 only
        - if the user input any other value you will need to ask (prompt() function) them again 
        - You can use "do while" or "while loop"
        - Put your question (prompt function) inside the loop
        - The loop should keep looping while the user input is not 1 or is not 2
        - If the user input is 1 or 2 we should stop asking (looping)        
        to make sure the user input will be numeric
        
        2- Ask (prompt) the user to input their numeric value. 
        - You will need again to keep asking the user till they input a valid numeric value
        - the same logic as above the condition to keep looping is different
        
               
        Pounds and Kilograms Converting:

        The mass m in pounds (lb) is equal to the mass m in kilograms (kg) divided by 0.45359237:
        m(lb) = m(kg) / 0.45359237

        Example:
        Convert 5kg to pounds:
        m(lb) = 5 kg / 0.45359237 = 11.023 lb
        ===============================================

        The mass m in kilograms (kg) is equal to the mass m in pounds (lb) times 0.45359237:
        m(kg) = m(lb) × 0.45359237

        Example:
        Convert 5 lb to kilograms:
        m(kg) = 5 lb × 0.45359237 = 2.268 kg


        3- Switch statement with two cases:
        case 1: call our function to convert kg to lb 
        case 2: call our function to convert lb to kg
        default: output a message (You don't need this default statement if you validate the user's choice)  
        */

        // creating two functions:
        // 1. convert kg to lb => accepts a numric value in kg ==> returns the value in lb (done)
        // You can name it "convertKgToLb()"
        // This function need to receive the value in KG ==> it needs one parameter

        // 2. convert lb to kg => accepts a numric value in lb ==> returns the value in kg (task)
        // You cna name it "convertLbToKg()"
        // This function need to receive the value in LB ==> it needs one parameter
