        Important Note to Review Again:
        It's better to place the JavaScript code or calling the external file at the end
        of loading all the HTML page elements for these two main reasons:
        1. To let the browser download the entire page (HTML and CSS) before trying to read the JS code. it's faster.
        2. For the DOM (Document Object Model) purpose as we will see why later in the future

        Reminder:
        The + sign in JS is used for "adding" numbers or "concatenating" string with numbers:

        /*
        Note:
        In this file, I will not use the alert(), but I will use console.log()
        just to avoid the annoying disturbing window that keeps alerting my test code.

        So I just kept the final 4 alert() to show us the result
        */

        // Notice the way we are naming our files: camelCase
        var myValue1 = "ABC"; // string (text) data type
        var myValue2 = 10; // number data type
        var result1 = myValue1 + myValue2; // "ABC" + 10 => "ABC" + "10" = "ABC10" as a string
        console.log(result1); // "ABC10" as a string data type

        var num1 = "100"; // the double quotes will make 100 as a string "100"
        var num2 = "200"; // and so on here also
        var numTotal = num1 + num2; // "100"+"200"
        console.log(numTotal); // 100200

        var firstName = "Alex";
        var lastName = "Chow";
        // concatenating two string values
        var fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "Alex"+" "+"Chow"=> Alex Chow
        console.log(fullName);

        // So only the + sign can be used with text: we can say "A"+"B"="AB"
        // But we cannot write "A"/"B" = "C"!!!!!

        var value1 = 7; // numeric value
        var value2 = "7"; // text value that has the character 7
        // this only with +
        console.log(value1 + value2); // => 7 and "7" = 77

        // below JS will "implicitly" convert value2 into a number
        // because the - is only used with numeric data
        console.log(value1 - value2); // 7 - "7" =JS will make it=> 7 - 7 = 0

        // more examples:
        var assignment1 = "90";
        var assignment2 = "80";
        var assignmentsTotal = assignment1 + assignment2;
        console.log("The total of my two assignments is: " + assignmentsTotal);


        var item1 = "abc";
        var item2 = 'xyz'; // we can either " or '
        console.log(item1 + item2); // "abc" + 'xyz' = abcxyz
        console.log(item1 - item2); // NaN => Not a Number
        console.log(item1 * item2); // NaN
        console.log(item1 / item2); // NaN

        /*
          Quick Review (Idea) About Methods or Functions:
          Method / Function always have ( and )
          example: we used alert()

          In between these "(" and ")", We can have parameter(s).
          Example:
          exam1=90;
          alert(exam1); // her exam1 is the alert function parameter

          Some times we can have more than one parameter:
          These parameters have to be separated with ","

          Our new function to learn is prompt():
          **************************************
          In this file we will use a new function named prompt() to help us getting data from the user
          We learnt how to output/print the data using alert() and console.log()

          for example, this prompt function can accept two parameters:
          - prompt("The text to be displayed", default value);
          - notice that default value is "optional" which means we can write (put) it or just ignore it

          prompt("Text that we want to display", default value)
      */

        /*
        the code below is hard coding, it means we are putting the values of these two exams using our code!
        we should give the user the option to enter their exam marks
        */
        // var exam1 = 90;
        // var exam2 = 89;


        /*
         We used alert() ==> JavaScript Built-in function
         to output (display) data to the browser

         We can use prompt() ==> JavaScript Built-in function
         to get data from the user instead of only displaying data, we can also receive data from the user!

         prompt function needs at least one parameter and the second one is optional
         prompt (string, value)
         Remember that the prompt function returns a value of type string (text value)

         In JavaScript, like any other programming language, function can return a value
         prompt function can accept two parameters (arguments)
         prompt ( Text to be displayed, default value).

         function can return values,
         We need to save the returned value of prompt() into a variable "var"
         so we can use this value in our code

         The returned value of the function prompt() is a string data type

         You might think about prompt is like contact us form in html,
         where we have a text to displayed plus a text box to put a value based on that text

         prompt() function: is designed to accept string user input and return a string data type
         even if the user input numeric values, these values will be converted to string

         if we click ok:
         - the value in the input box will be taken
         - No value in the input box, it will just an empty string

         if we click "cancel":
         - the value will be "null"
       */
        var clientName = prompt("Hi there! What's your name please?");
        console.log("Your full name is: " + clientName);
        // using the built-in function typeof() to return the data type (not the value)
        console.log(typeof (clientName)); // "string" if we click "OK", "object" if we click "cancel"

        /*
        In our example the first prompt() function will return the value of exam1 and so on

        Below we put the second parameter to be 0 as a default value,
        so if the user forgot to put the exam mark, the value will be 0
        */

        // Below: if the user didn't put any value for the first/second exam, the default value will be 0
        var exam1 = prompt("Enter the value of your first exam:", 0); // 10 as a number => prompt will return "10"
        var exam2 = prompt("Enter the value of your second exam:", 0); // 8 as a number => prompt will return "8"

        // for testing:
        console.log("Your exam1 mark is " + exam1);
        console.log("Your exam2 mark is " + exam2);

        // testing the input data type:
        console.log(typeof (exam1)); // "number" if we click "OK"
        console.log(typeof (exam2)); // "number" if we click "OK"

        // Because the two values are returned from the prompt() function as string
        // So JS will use the + for concatenating these two string variables
        var total = exam1 + exam2; // "10" + "8" = "108"
        console.log("The total of exam1 and exam2 is: " + total);
        // Or:
        console.log("The total of exam1 and exam2 is: " + (exam1 + exam2));

        // let's try the other operations:
        // because these 3 symbols (-, *, /) work only with numbers (Math operations)
        // and also because this symbol (+) can work as a math operation or as a concatenating symbol
        // That's why JS will convert the string "10" into 10 as number and convert "8" into 8 as number
        console.log(exam1 - exam2); // works: "10" - "8" => 10 - 8 = 2
        console.log(exam1 * exam2); // works: "10" * "8" => 10 * 8 = 80
        console.log(exam1 / exam2); // works: "10" / "8" => 10 / 8  = 1.25
        // but if we have "10" + "8" = 108 <= Here is the problem!

        // also for our previous example:
        // var book1 = 40.75; NO Hard Coding anymore!
        var book1 = prompt("Enter the price of your first book"); // 78.56
        var book2 = prompt("Enter the price of your second book"); // 34.18
        var bookTotal = book1 + book2;
        console.log("The total of your two books is: $" + bookTotal);

        /*
        the returned value of prompt function is always a "string" data type,
        so it's not numeric even if the user put numbers!

        prompt() function returns a string value by JavaScript!
        so even if the user type 90 JS will make it "90" or '90' as string data type
        the prompt() function will automatically convert it to a string by adding the " or '

        var exam1=prompt("Enter the value of your first exam",0); => if the user inputs 100 as number
        the returned value will be "100" for example
        with "+" ==> "100"+"90" = 10090
        so in this case JS will concatenate "100" to "90" because both
        value 100 and 90 are string data type not numeric

        In JavaScript the "+" symbol or sign is used for:
        - concatenating (for text values)
        - adding (for numeric values)

        so JS will use the concatenate operator +
        because the + symbol is used for addition or concatenating

        Let's take this example:

        exam1 = 8 with prompt(): convert the input into a text ==> "8"
        exam2 = 5 with prompt(): convert the input into a text ==> "5"

        JS Interpreter will see the values as text "8" and "5"
        for this reason "8"+"5" ==> 85 like "A"+"B" ==> AB
        so the + sign will be a concatenating operation NOT arithmetic operation

        8+5 as numbers not "8"+"5" as text
        */

        // to fix it, we need to convert the returned value from the prompt() into a number
        /*
        We have two built-in JS functions to explicitly convert (text value) to (numeric value)

        - parseFloat() ==> to deal with integer (Whole) or float (decimal) numbers
        example: 89.75 or even 89

        - parseInt() ==> to deal only with integer(Whole) value only
          int is short for integer
          example: 89 ==> it has to be an integer value (no decimal point)

        Note:
        parseFloat works with the both types of numbers: integers and decimals
        parseInt can work only with whole number and it will ignore the decimals

        Examples:
        parseFloat("90.75") ==> 90.75 as numeric value
        parseInt("90.75") ==> 90 as numeric value (ignore the decimals!!!!)
        parseInt("7") ==> 7 as numeric value

        be careful with this example below:
        parseInt("78.5") ==> 78 (ignore the decimals!!!!)
        */

        // Now we can use one these function to solve our problem :-)

        // getting the old "string" value of exam1 and using parseFloat() to make it "numeric" value
        // then assign it back to our same variable exam1
        exam1 = parseFloat(exam1); // "100" => 100 Or "89.72" => 89.72

        // And we can repeat the same step with exam2:
        exam2 = parseFloat(exam2); // "90.67" => 90.67

        // Just for testing:
        console.log("Again the correct total of exam1 + exam2 after pars is: " + (exam1 + exam2));
        // OR:
        var examTotal = exam1 + exam2;
        console.log("Again the correct total of exam1 + exam2 is: " + examTotal);

        var average = examTotal / 2; // divided by 2 because we have two exams
        console.log("the average of exam1 and exam2 is: " + average);

        // We can use the same functions with book price problem
        /*
        book1 =  parseFloat(book1);
        book2 =  parseFloat(book2);
        */
        bookTotal = parseFloat(book1) + parseFloat(book2);
        console.log("Again the correct total of book1 price + book2 price is: " + bookTotal);

        // or for some of you:
        /*
            Like Any Programming language, JavaScript also follows the Math rules (like MS Excel):
            PEDMAS OR BEDMAS
            P => Parenthesis: ( and ) OR B => Brackets
            E => Exponent => example: 5 to the power of 2 which means 5 x 5 = 25
            D => Division
            M => Multiplication
            A => Addition
            S => Subtraction
        */
        // var average = (exam1+exam2)/2; // PEDMAS

        console.log("The average of your two exams is " + average);
        // Or more advanced:
        // if the user inserted 100 for exam1 and 90 for exam2
        // the output: the average of 100 and 90 is XX
        // text + Exam1 value + text + Exam2 value + text + average value
        // below we used ' instead of " because in JS we can use both
        console.log('The average of ' + exam1 + ' and ' + exam2 + ' is: ' + average);

        // More example:
        console.log('Hi ' + clientName + '! Your average for ' + exam1 + ' and ' + exam2 + ' is: ' + average)

        // To summarize:
        // we can use parseFloat() to get
        // both whole numbers (integers)
        // float numbers (decimal numbers)
