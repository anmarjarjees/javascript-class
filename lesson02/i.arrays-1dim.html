    // declare a variable that can contain only one value:
    /* using camelCase for naming convention */
    var myLuckyNumber = 7; // if I want to use one number

    // Question: What if we have 5 lucky numbers:
    var myLuckyNumber1 = 9;
    var myLuckyNumber2 = 3;
    var myLuckyNumber3 = 10;
    var myLuckyNumber4 = 25;
    var myLuckyNumber5 = 30;
    // above we have declared 5 separate variables to save 5 lucky numbers!
    // to save my lucky numbers

    // In JavaScript like any other languages
    // we can create a variable that can save/have many/multiple values
    // 5 values/numbers for example:
    // if we can create a variable "myLuckyNumbers"
    // and myLuckyNumbers can have all my numbers
    // we need to use "array"
    // this kind of variable that contains more than one value is named "array"

    // the rules for creating an array variable
    // array uses the [ and ] symbols to refer to its content (elements),
    // all the contents (values) have to be in between [ ]
    // the content of the array has to be a comma separated values
    // below we added spaces to show you that spaces here are fine (no errors)
    /*
        ( and ) => parenthesis (brackets)
        { and } => curly brace
        [ and ] => square bracket
    */

    // testing:
    console.log(myLuckyNumbers); // Array(5)

    /*
    - Arrays can have multiple values
    - Each element (value) inside the array has a unique index (like StudentID for student)
      which the address to access that specific value
    - Arrays in JavaScript like many other languages are 0 based index,
      so the first element/item in the array has the index of 0
    - in the above example:
    the value/element 10 has the index of 2
    */

    Review:
    The same with a simple variable,
    we can initialize a variable in the same line:
    var myValue1=5;

    OR declare a variable then give it a value on the second line:
    var myBestFriend;
    myBestFriend="Tom"; // 'Tom';

    We can declare an empty array, then we can add elements to this empty array
    below is a short version of creating a new array:
    */
    var myExams = [];  // just declaring an empty array
    // We can add the values to myExams array for each index (adding 5 exam marks):
    console.log(myExams); // [] => length: 0
    myExams[0] = 90;
    myExams[1] = 94;
    myExams[2] = 82;
    myExams[3] = 75;
    myExams[4] = 78;
    /*
    you might think we could have created the array like this:
    The better smart way:
    In this simple example, we should use one line:
    var myExams=[90,94,82,75,78];
    */
    // to output the value of my first exam:
    // the value of the first exam is inside myExams array
    // using console message "Your first exam is: 90"
    console.log("Your first exam is: " + myExams[0])

    /* creating an array of subjects */
    /*
    - "Dreamweaver" with double quote
    - 'Photoshop' with single quote
    - try to avoid mixing them as shown below!!!
    */
    var mySubjects = ["Dreamweaver", 'Photoshop', "JavaScript"];
    /*
    So again:
    array has index, each element inside the array has its own unique index value
    JS like PHP and other languages is 0 based index

    first element has index of 0 which is "Dreamweaver"
    second element has index of 1

    JavaScript has the index of 2
    */

    // More example: (working as Front-End Developer)
    var myFavSubjects = ["HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"];

    // for testing: output the CSS subject of the array:
    console.log(myFavSubjects[1]) // CSS

    // Task Output:
    // "We should start by learning {HTML} then {CSS} before learning {JavaScript}"
    // use console.log() and we need to access these subjects by calling the array myFavSubjects
    // writing the console using the array structure:
    // the first element (index:0) of my myFavSubjects is "HTML"
    // the second element (index:1) of my myFavSubjects is "CSS"
    // the third element (index:3) of my myFavSubjects is "JavaScript"
    console.log("We should start by learning " + myFavSubjects[0] + " then " + myFavSubjects[1] + " before learning " + myFavSubjects[2]);

    /*
    Another way of declaring an empty array using a long version (Object way):
    var Array: ArrayConstructor
    */
    var myShoppingList = new Array();
    /*
    The code above is exactly as we say/write:
    var myShoppingList = [];
    */

    // then we can insert the values by specifying the index for each one
    myShoppingList[0] = "Green Tea";
    myShoppingList[1] = "Sugar";
    myShoppingList[2] = "Tomato";
    myShoppingList[3] = "Milk";

    // for testing:
    console.log("My last item in my shopping list is " + myShoppingList[4]);
    // the output (there is no idex 4): My last item in my shopping list is undefined

    // Task:
    // Find the average of my 5 exams:
    // logic/formula in MS Excel: (exam1+exam2+exam3+exam4+exam5)/5
    // in JS: average =(exam1+exam2+exam3+exam4+exam5)/5
    // Note: call the values based on their index inside the array
    // var avg = 90+94+82+75+78/5; // Wrong => PEDMAS
    // var avg = (90+94+82+75+78)/5; // Right => PEDMAS
    var average = (myExams[0] + myExams[1] + myExams[2] + myExams[3] + myExams[4]) / 5;
    // we can use console.log:
    console.log("The average is: " + average); // The average is: 83.8

    /*
    Conclusion:
    - Array: is a variable that can contain multiple values
    - Each value has an "index number"
    - The array index starts with 0
    - The first index will be 0 and highest index in the array will the length of the array - 1

    Example:
    myShoppingList has 4 elements which means its length is 4
    so the index of the last item is 4 - 1 = 3
    which is right, the index of element "Milk" in myShoppingList is 3
    output: myShoppingList[3] ==> this will be "Milk"
    */

    // More Examples (Tasks for my students):
    // Task#1: declare a new empty array:
    // this array will contains the marks of 3 exams so you can name it "finalExams"
    var finalExams = [];

    // I want to insert 90 into the array:
    // finalExams[0]=90; // but not by hard coding
    /*
    instead of populate the array with the 3 exams marks using hard coding,
    we will get these three marks from the user and save them directly into our array "finalExams[]
    */

    // Task#2
    /*
    Ask the user to input the first exam using prompt() function
    The returned value of prompt() should be saved into the finalExams[0]
    */
    finalExams[0] = prompt("Enter your first exam");
    finalExams[0] = parseFloat(finalExams[0]);


    // do the same for exam2 and exam3:
    finalExams[1] = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your second exam"));
    finalExams[2] = parseFloat(prompt("Enter your third exam"));

    // for testing:
    // we will do the old classical way
    var examsTotal = finalExams[0] + finalExams[1] + finalExams[2];
    // just output the value of examsTotal:
    document.write("Exams Total is:" + examsTotal);
    document.write("<hr>");
    /*
    document.write() like "alert()" and "console.log()", so we can write a full formula
    or equation and get the result!
    */

    // Task#3
    // output the total of the three exams
    // using document.write() directly
    // without creating a variable "total"
    // "The total is: xy"

    /*
    When we add with "+" text to numeric value
    JS will convert this numeric value into a text

    so if put: "ABC"+1+2+3
    this will be converted into "ABC"+"1"+"2"+"3"
    so the result will be ABC123 and NOT ABC6 !

    because the "+" is used for both:
    - concatenating
    - addition operation

    Very Important Note:
    so just to let JS distinguish between the text and
    our formula, we just need to enclose our equation/formula
    within the opening and closing parenthesis ( )
    */
    document.write("The total is: " + (finalExams[0] + finalExams[1] + finalExams[2]));


    /*
    Very Important Note:
    Please remember that every thing in JavaScript is an object!
    ------------------------------------------------------------

    *******************
    Array is an object:
    *******************
    Note: We will talk about the idea of object later in more details

    Object in JS like any object (item) in our life: a car, a pen, a house, a keyboard, etc...

    In our real life any object can have two things, let's take the "car" object for example:
    1- specifications/descriptions => 4WD, White color, 2010, Dodge
    2- action (verb) => drive forward, reverse, beeping, turn lef/right

    Let's take the "pen" as real-life object:
    1- specs(specifications): Brand => Sharpie, Color => Light Yellow, Type => Highlighter
    2- actions: Highlight

    As we have objects in real-life, any programming language has objects
    Objects in JS (or any programming language) can have the following two members:
    1- properties (like specs/descriptions for our real life objects)
    2- methods (like actions for our real life objects)

    Because in JavaScript, Array is an object which means array has "properties" and "methods"
    The object properties and methods can make our coding much easier and faster.

    To access the properties or the methods that belong to each object:

    The object syntax (using the dot notation):
    objectName.ObjectProperty
    objectName.ObjectMethod()

    exactly lie "console", yes, it's an object!
    console.log() => using the method log() for the console object

    Noticed that the property doesn't have ()
    while method name ends with () == because method is just a function for that object
    and any function in JS has ( and ) like: alert(), prompt(), parseInt(), parseFloat()

    Our current object which is the array "fruits" has:
    - Property => length
    - has these two methods for Popping and Pushing:

    When you work with arrays, it is easy to remove elements and add new elements.
    This is what popping and pushing is:
    Popping items out of an array, or pushing items into an array.

    Popping:
    The "pop()"" method removes the last element from an array:

    Pushing:
    The "push()"" method adds a new element to an array (at the end):


    The syntax:
    arrayName.pop()
    arrayName.push(value)
    */

    // Let's create an array of fruits named "fruits":
    var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    // fruits => array => object => has "properties" and "methods"
    console.log(fruits);

    // Task:
    // Removes the last element ("Mango") from fruits array
    // don't forget that method like function, has to have at the end ( and )
    fruits.pop(); // will remove the last item in the array
    console.log(fruits); // Banana Orange Apple

    // let's create another array of cars:
    var cars = ["Honda", "Nissan", "Dodge", "Toyota"];
    console.log(cars);
    // Adds a new element (car) "Ford"
    // cars[4]="Ford"
    // Or:
    cars.push("Ford");
    console.log(cars);

    // We can use the length property of the array object
    console.log("Now, we have " + cars.length + " cars!");

    // To summarize: array is an object:
    console.log(typeof (fruits)); // object
    console.log(typeof (cars)); // object

    // anything in JS is an object even the other types: string, number, boolean:
    // for fun and quick practice:
    var myTextbook = "Beginning JavaScript";
    console.log(typeof (myTextbook)); // string
    // since everything is an object in JS, so string is also an object
    console.log(myTextbook.length); // 20
    // toUpperCase() => Converts all the alphabetic characters in a string to uppercase.
    console.log(myTextbook.toUpperCase()); // BEGINNING JAVASCRIPT
