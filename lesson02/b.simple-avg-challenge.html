    <title>Average with JavaScript (Challenge)</title>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- 
        General Math Rules:
        In JS we have 5 operations (symbols):
        + for addition
        - for subtraction
        * for multiplication
        / for division
        % for the remainder of the division

Task:
using <script> element:
1- declare 3 different variables for 3 different exams
using any descriptive names you like for example "exam1" and "exam2"
and initialize them with random values.
You will assign an amount of number to each one exam1 variable and exam2 variable

2- declare a new variable for the average with any name
like "avg" or "average" and this variable will receive the average value for the three exams using the right formula for finding the average of any 3 numeric values

3- use either alert or console.log or both to output the value of the average variable
-->
    <script>
        // 1:
        // Using the keyword "var" to declare our 3 variables:
        var exam1 = 80;
        var exam2 = 92;
        var exam3 = 87;

        // 2:
        // student answer1:
        // in this case no need to declare a variable "average"
        // alert((exam1+exam2+exam3)/3); // 2 + 3 at the same line

        // student answer2:
        var total = exam1 + exam2 + exam3; // 
        // oneValue/3 ==> no need to write (oneValue)/3
        // total/3 ==> no need to write (average)/3
        alert(total / 3);

        // student answer3:
        // find the average
        // below we are following the 
        var examAverage = (exam1 + exam2 + exam3) / 3;

        // next step:
        // alert(examaverage); // error: examAverage is not examaverage
        // examaverage is not defined
        alert(examAverage);
        // or
        console.log(examAverage);
    </script>
