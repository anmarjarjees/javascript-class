        Dear Students,
        This code example was taken from my code example of using inheritance with Python language.
        So the same example in Python has been to translated to JavaScript

        W3Schools:
        ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.
        JavaScript Classes are templates for JavaScript Objects.

            - It has to have the exact name "constructor"
            - It is executed automatically when a new object is created
            - It is used to initialize object properties
            - If you do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.
