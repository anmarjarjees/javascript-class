            To Review:
            In JS, we can see we have alert() or console.log()
            anyName() => It's a function (method) because it has "(" and ")"
            example:
            alert() => function/method
            alert is built-in function or built-in method
       */

        // Create 5 variables for 5 games scores and find the total:
        var game1; // only declaring game1 variable without giving it any value yet
        // alert(game1); // undefined
        game1 = 100; // assign 100 to game1 variable
        // alert(game1); // 100

        // The code below will produce an error:
        // alert(game2); // game2 is not defined
        var game2 = 203;
        var game3 = 561;
        var game4 = 305;
        var game5 = 370;

        // We can find the total of all these games and output the result using console:
        console.log(game1 + game2 + game3 + game4 + game5); // output: 1539

        // Use a new variable to find the total
        var gamesPointTotal = game1 + game2 + game3 + game4 + game5;
        console.log(gamesPointTotal); // output: 1539

        // display: The total of games points is x
        // print or to output the total variable which is "gamesPointTotal"
        // we need to output the gamesPointTotal
        // I want to see this message: The total of games points is 1539

        The solution for combining text and amount of number (variable's value):
        below are alerting text and numeric value
        below we need to add text value to a numeric value
        so we have to "concatenate" these two different data type values
        In JavaScript the symbol for concatenating is +
        text + variable value

        Before solving this issue, let's try the "concatenation" subject
        check the examples below:
        */
        var firstName = "Alex";
        var lastName = "Chow";
        // below we are using the + symbol not as addition math operation
        // in JS the + symbol can be also used to combine strings also!
        var fullName = firstName + lastName; // "Alex"+"Chow" => AlexChow
        console.log(fullName);

        // since I want to use/update the same varaible "fullName" => don't use var
        fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "Alex"+" "+"Chow" => Alex Chow
        console.log(fullName);

        // return to our main code about the game total points:
        // adding/concatenating the string (text): The total of games points is
        // to the variable: gamesPointTotal
        alert("The total of games points is " + gamesPointTotal);

        // the same rules can applied to console.log:
        console.log("The total of games points is: " + gamesPointTotal);;

        // Let's try to find the average of these 5 games:
        // we can output the average of the games points
        // console.log(gamesPointTotal/5);
        // or we can create a new variable called average:
        var average = gamesPointTotal / 5;
        // using console.log() output: The average of the 5 games is: x
        console.log("The average of the 5 games is: " + average);

        /************************* Task: *************************/
        /*
        1. Declare two different variables:
        one variable for first exam
        second variable for second exam
        assign an exam value to each one of them

        we are hard coding the values just for now
        */
        var exam1 = 88;
        var exam2 = 90;

        /*
        2. Finding the average:
        Declare a new variable for the average equation
        and find the average of these two exams
        */
        var avg = (exam1 + exam2) / 2;

        console.log("The average is: " + avg); // The average is: 89

        /*
        3. Output (console window):
        "The average of [first exam value] and [second exam value] is: [average value]"

        NOTE: use the variables exam1 (88) and exam2 (90) in the message
        Don't type the exam values as a literal text!

        Example:
        if the first exam value is: 88
        and the second exam value is" 90
        their average is 90.5

        the output in the console should be like this:
        The average of 89 and 92 is: 89

        Notice below we are using the + sign for concatenating text and values
        */
        console.log("The average of " + exam1 + " and " + exam2 + " is: " + avg);

        // more examples:
        var num1 = 100; // a pure numeric value
        var num2 = "200"; // a numeric value but because of the ", JS will treat it as string (text)!
        // JS: number + string => JS will concatenate them
        // JS: string + string => JS will concatenate them
        // JS: number + number => JS will add (the math operation +) them
        console.log(num1 + num2); 100200

        // Another modern way to use something called "literal template"
        /*
        We can inject the values using the ${TextGoesHere} into "Template Literals" Syntax
        That We Used For Concatenation:
        */
        // we can ignore the ' or " and just warp our entire text with ` first
        // wrap every variable with { } with the symbol of $ => ${variableName}
        console.log(`The average of ${exam1} and ${exam2} is: ${avg}`);
