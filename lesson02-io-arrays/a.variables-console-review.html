    <!-- Writing JavaScript code -->

        // Review:
        // JavaScript can have containers called "Variables"
        // Variables are used to save any types of values
        // we need to (should) declare the variable before using it:
        // To declare a new variable, we can use the keyword "var" or "let" or "const"
        var x;
        x = 200;
        alert(x);

        // We can declare and initialize a new variable
        // in the same line (at the same time):
        var y = 100;

        // since both variables x and y have values:
        alert(x + y);

        /*
        if you find using alert() method (function)
        is annoying, we can output our result into the console window.
        In this case the output will not be pop-up in the
        browser window, it will just be written inside the
        console window
        */
        // error: console is not a function
        // console(x + y); // Error => console is not a function
        // Yes we have a built-in named "alert()" but we don't have "console()"
        console.log(x + y); // out put 300 inside the console window

        /*
        It's a good practice to create a new variable using a meaningful names
        or descriptive names
        like exam1 instead of just e1
        like average instead of just a
        */
        var e1 = 90; // what's e1?
        var exam1 = 90; // it's more clear for us as human
        var avg; /* to refer to the user's age better than using a or Monday or August !! */
        /*
        - We cannot start the variable name with a number
        or other special characters like & ! * - ) ( $ # @
        - We cannot have spaces or special characters inside the file name
        */

        // 2exam = 89; // error

        /*
        we should always use the keyword var when we declare a new variable
        to specify its scope (we will talk about scope later)
        */
        var exam2 = 89;
        // instead of using alert function, use console.log
        console.log(exam1 + exam2);

        // Since JavaScript is "case sensitive"
        // so the variable below "Exam2" is not the same like "exam2"
        var Exam2 = 92;

        /*
        We should avoid using this way of naming:
        like creating two different variables with the
        same name exactly but with different case:
        var value1 = 10;
        var Value1 = 20;
        */

        /* Naming Convention */
        /*
        The naming convention that most developers follow:
        to name their variables in JavaScript or PHP by using "camelCase"

        Examples:
        var firstExam;
        var studentAverage;
        var monthlyPaymentTotal;
        var exam1
        var myCar
        var myCollegeName

        Even with the method/function names (We will talk about functions later):
        myFunction()

        calculateGrossPay()
        ===============================================
        Other High level languages like C# or JAVA,
        they use "PascalCase":
        examples:
        var FirstDegree;
        FindTotalPayment();
        */

        // Task: The average of the two exams":
        // 3 ways of writing this code:

        // 1.
        // we can alert the answer directly:  alert((exam1 + exam2) / 2);
        // notice the same command we can write using the console window
        console.log((exam1 + exam2) / 2);

        // 2. creating two variables: total and average
        var total = exam1 + exam2;
        var average = total / 2;
        console.log(average);

        // We can declare multiple varaibles in the same line using one keyword "var" with ,
        var book1, book2, book3;

        // 3. create one variable to get the average result instantly:
        /*
        PEDMAS OR BEDMAS:  (to be explained later)
        */

        var avg = (exam1 + exam2) / 2;
        console.log(avg);
        // or we can use the console window to output the result:
        console.log("This text will be inside the console window");
        console.log(avg); // This value will appear only inside the console window (F12)

        /*
        Functions (Methods) Examples:
        the function pattern: name() => function always ends with ( and )

        Examples:
        alert()
        console.log()

        later, we will learn these:
        prompt()
        parseFloat()
        */
