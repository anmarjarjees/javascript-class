The user needs to input the prices of their 3 textbooks
to find the total price of these 3 books

        Task:
        - Ask the user to input the price of his/her first book
        - Ask the user to input the price of his/her second book
        - Ask the user to input the price of his/her third book

        Notice that in every question you will need to save the user's input into a variable

        - alert the result of the total for the three books

        Note:
        don't forget to parse the user input

        Besides these two very specific functions that convert text to numbers:
        - parseFloat()
        - parseInt()
    
        JS also has another general function to convert text to number:
        Number() <= be careful that N is capital
        you can see that Number() function doesn't follow the naming convention "camelCase"
        because it's a "Constructor"
    
        The Number() function converts the object argument to a number that represents the object's value.
        If the value cannot be converted to a legal number, NaN is returned.
