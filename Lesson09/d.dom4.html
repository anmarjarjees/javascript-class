            HTML NOTES about "required" attribute field validation:
            ------------------------------------------------------
            We have an official form element with submit button,
            But still we can NOT use the attribute "required" => it's useless in this example
            because we are using the "return false" trick to avoid the form from being submitted

            Notes:
            - Please remember that you type the full attribute required="required" or just type required
            - this attribute only works when the form is submitted (type="submit")
            - Notice that return false will prevent the from from being submitted
            - You can use the title attribute just to give a hint about any input field

            If you want to customize the HTML warning message:
            https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation
         -->
        <input type="text" id="numbers" title="Please add one space between numbers">

        <p>Please, select your operation:</p>
        <!-- 
            HTML Review:
            Below, we can NOT omit/ignore the "name" attribute
            as we need it to group the radio button items

            we used value="*" so we will get this symbol "*" if the user clicks mul radio button
            we used value="/" so we will get this symbol "/" if the user clicks div radio button

            you as programmer, you can choose:
            value="1" for mul
            value="2" for div
            value="3" for count
            Or
            value="m" for mul
            value="d" for div
            value="c" for count

            Or anything else you prefer...
        -->

        <input type="radio" name="operation" id="mul" checked value="1">
        <label for="mul">Multiply Numbers</label>
        <br>

        <input type="radio" name="operation" id="div" value="2">
        <label for="div">Divide Numbers</label>
        <br>

        <input type="radio" name="operation" id="ctn" value="3">
        <label for="ctn">Count how many numbers</label>
        <div>
            <div>
                <!-- 
                Either using type="submit" to have the required attribute working
                or using type="button" but the required attribute will not work

                One of the tricks that we discussed before is using/adding the code: return false
                after calling our function.
                This "return false" will prevent the default behaviour of the browser from being refreshed
                after submitting the form
            -->
                <input type="submit" value="Calculate" onclick="findResult(); return false">
                <input type="reset" value="Clear Numbers">
            </div>
    </form>

    <!-- Let's add the element to receive the result through DOM: -->
    <p>The result: <span id="result"></span></p>

    <!-- 
        for practice, let's create an external js file (Main Assignment) 
        The JS code to manipulate this page is written inside a folder named "js"
        and the file name is "dom4-script.js"
    -->
    <script src="js/dom4-script.js"></script>
