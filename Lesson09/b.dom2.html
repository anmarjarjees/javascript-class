        <!--
            NOTE: This file is very important for the second assignment
        -->
        <h1 id="first">Simple Calculations</h1>
        <!--
            Using <form> element:

            "action" attribute is only needed if you want to specify the destination/or the file to handle
            the form in the server (which is the php for example => our next module).

            In this example we don't need "action" attribute, nothing to be sent to the server
            we will do our code to handle the from using JavaScript in the client's browser (front-end).

            "method" attribute is needed to specify the submission using:
            - GET
            - POST
            Again, we need these two values to be use with the back-end development as we will do in PHP module

            Very Important Note:
            Since we are only using JavaScript and nothing to be submitted to the server, we don't need this attributes
            - action
            - method

            Yes, in such case we can ignore using the from element just the some of its fields

         -->
        <form id="main-form">
            <label for="number">Enter any numeric value:</label>
            <!--
                required => this field is required to have some content when the form is being submitted
                the required attribute works ONLY when the from is being submitted

                In our code below we are using this trick to prevent the form from being submitted
                so adding/removing the attribute "required" will not make any difference

                In such case, we can write our custom JS code to check the form if it's empty or not empty
             -->
            <input type="text" name="number" id="number" size="5" maxlength="10">

            <div>
                <!--
                    input element is an empty element => the label of this button will be inside the value attribute
                    as in the examples below:
                    the labels "Submit1" and "Submit2" are inside the value attributes:
                    - value="Submit1"
                    - value="Submit2"

                    We can use this code <input type="button"...
                    type="button":
                    - prevents the form from being submitted to the server
                    - prevents the page from being refreshed again.

                    Notice that using this way, no need to return false
                    as it will be explained later below:
                 -->
                <input type="button" value="Submit1" onclick="checkNumber1();">
                <br>
                <!--
                Using type="submit":
                In such case, we need to use return false to prevent the from from being submitted
                to the same page.

                NOTE:
                The form is submitted to the page itself if there is no action attribute
                to specify other distention.

                If the form is submitted to the page, the page will be reloaded (refreshed)
                ==> refresh the page means clear everything!

                So we can:
                1. we need to add the keyword return within the onclick event: onclick="return checkNumber2()
                2. we need to write at the end of our function "checkNumber2": return false
                -->
                <input type="submit" value="Submit2" onclick="return checkNumber2();">
                <br>
                <!--
                    button element is not an empty => it has an opining and closing tags
                    so the label for this element is placed in between the opening and the closing tag elements
                    - <button ...>Submit3</button>
                    - <button ...>Submit4</button>

                    OR: if you don't want to change your function or adding anything to your function
               like we don't' want to add "return false" as the first way, you can this second way:

               Second way: by adding return false to the "onclick" event:
               onclick="checkNumber3(); return false"

               Notice that this way we don't need the statement "return false" in our function
               because we put it here: return false
                 -->
                <button type="submit" onclick="checkNumber3(); return false">Submit3</button>
                <br>
                <!--
                    Since we don't have to use the real action form which is submitting to the server, we can also just use simple button element
                    without any type!
                 -->
                <button onclick="checkNumber4();">Submit4</button>
            </div>
        </form>
        <p>The total of your numbers: <span id="result"> </span></p>
    </div>

    <!--
        The best practice is to make sure that all the page elements are loaded before staring paring them in JS
        which means we should place our JS DOM code after loading all the document elements:
    -->
    <!-- Internal JavaScript -->
    <script>
        // below is the function to find the total of x numbers that use inputs

        // This function "checkNumber1()" will be called/run on click event for "Submit1"
        function checkNumber1() {
            // for test:
            // alert(" checkNumber1() is called!");

            /*
            // look the code below:
           var userNumber = document.getElementById("number");
           console.log(inputDataStr); //  <input type="text" name="numbers" id="number" size="5" maxlength="10">
           */
            // We need only the value inside the input field not the entire input element!
            // We can use the property named "value"!
            var userNumber = document.getElementById("number").value;

            var numType;
            if (userNumber % 2 == 0) {
                numType = "Even number";
            } else {
                numType = "Odd number";
            }

            // We can use .innerHTML
            document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = numType;
            // Or since there is not HTML element just the value/text itself we can use .innerText:
            document.getElementById("result").innerText = numType;
        } // end function checkNumber1

        function checkNumber2() {
            // for test:
            // alert(" checkNumber2() is called!");
            // Below is just the same code:
            var userNumber = document.getElementById("number").value;

            // Instead of using the full if/else block, we can use the ternary operator :-)
            // Syntax: condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
            // For more refreshment:
            // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
            var numType = (userNumber % 2 == 0) ? "Even number" : "Odd number";
            document.getElementById("result").innerText = numType;

            // to prevent the browser from being reloaded after submitting the form using type="submit"
            // we can add the very end of our function: return false;
            // we also need to add the keyword "return" before our function call on the "Click Handler"
            return false;
        } // end function checkNumber2

        function checkNumber3() {
            // for test:
            // alert(" checkNumber3() is called!");

            var userNumber = document.getElementById("number").value;
            /*
            Instead of writing this line:
            // var numType = (userNumber % 2 == 0) ? "Even number" : "Odd number";
            We can just place the ternary operator as the value for .innerText:
            */
            document.getElementById("result").innerText = (userNumber % 2 == 0) ? "Even number" : "Odd number";

            /*
            In this function, we didn't add: return false;
            because we added to the click event after calling our function!
            */
        } // end function checkNumber3

        function checkNumber4() {
            // for test:
            // alert(" checkNumber3() is called!");
