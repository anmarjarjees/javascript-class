        // Using Classes in JavaScript:
        /*
        The term "classes" has been introduced to us
        in JavaScript2015 Es6

        it's called "Syntactic Sugar"
        so it's not a changing in the infrastructure in dealing with Objects in JS
        it's just a different (modern) way as we use in other OO languages

        Just a new syntax

        Let's take the same example of the "House" but with a simple version for a quick demonstration

        House(modelName, bedRoomNum, hasGuestRoom, finishedBasement, kitchenNum, garageNum, bathRoomNum, flooringType = "Laminate") {
        }

        class is a blue print for creating an object
        */

        class House {
            // Creating the class constructor:
            constructor(modelName, bedRoomNum, finishedBasement, kitchenNum, garageNum, bathRoomNum) {
                this.name = modelName;
                this.bedrooms = bedRoomNum;
                this.finishedBasement = finishedBasement;
                this.kitchenNum = kitchenNum;
                this.garage = garageNum;
                this.bathrooms = bathRoomNum;

                // We can also add these properties that doesn't need a passing value:
                this.builder = "Dream Homes Inc.";
            }

            // creating a method (a function inside a class):
            // Notice that we don't use the "function" keyword:
            build() {
                console.log(`${this.builder}: Building a house with these specifications:
                House Model: ${this.name}
                Bedrooms: ${this.bedrooms}
                Basement: ${this.finishedBasement}
                Kitchen: ${this.kitchenNum}
                Garage: ${this.garage}
                bathrooms: ${this.bathrooms}`);
            }

            /*
                JS doesn't have the access modifiers (private, public, protected)
                like other OO languages.
                But we can imitate the same idea by creating:
                - getter method
                - setter method

                For more details and explanations,
                please refer to my lectures of working with Object Oriented Programming using:
                - PHP
                - Python

                Examples of JS:
                - Getting the value of the House bedrooms number
                - Using the keyword "get" followed by a method name as we use the keyword "function"
                - we can NOT use/call the actual property name after get, using a meaningful name
                
                NOTE:
                getter and setter methods are called without ()
            */

            // Getter method for getting the value of the "bedrooms" property:
            get getBedrooms() {
                return this.bedrooms;
            }

            // Setter method for setting the value of the "bedrooms" property:
            set setBedrooms(number) {
                this.bedrooms = number;
            }

            /*
            To make the code easier in JS,
            Developers usually use getter and setter like a class method without any keyword:
            So let's try it on "Bathrooms":
            */

            // Getter: using get then the property name by convention
            getBathrooms() {
                return this.bathrooms;
            }

            // Setter: using set then the property name by convention
            setBathrooms(number) {
                this.bathrooms = number;
            }
        } // end class House

        // Creating an object out of the class:
        const house1 = new House("Astoria", 3, true, 1, 2, 2);
        const house2 = new House("Presto", 2, false, 1, 1, 2);
        const house3 = new House("Galaxy", 2, true, 2, 1, 2);

        // Calling the class method build()
        house1.build();
        house2.build();
        house3.build();

        // Accessing a class property for the object "house1":
        console.log('First House Bedrooms#:', house1.bedrooms); // First House Bedrooms#: 3

        //  We can also change the value of any property"
        house1.bedrooms = 4;
        console.log('First House Bedrooms#:', house1.bedrooms); // First House Bedrooms#: 4


        console.log('Second House Bedrooms#:', house2.bedrooms);
        // Using the getter and setter method with the object "house2":
        house2.setBedrooms = 7; // Error => setBedrooms(7);
        console.log('Second House Bedrooms#:', house2.getBedrooms); // Second House Bedrooms#: 7

        // For more details: 
        // https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_accessors.asp

        // Accessing the getter and setter of the property "bedrooms" of the third house:
        console.log('Third House Bathrooms#:', house3.getBathrooms()); // Third House Bathrooms#: 2

        house3.setBathrooms(3);
        console.log('Third House Bathrooms#:', house3.getBathrooms()); // Third House Bathrooms#: 3
