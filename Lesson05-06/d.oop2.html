      We can use "class" in other languages like PHP or Python to create a blueprint of multiple objects
      then we can create multiple objects (instances) of that class (blueprint)

      in JS there is NO keyword/structure named "class"

      In JS we can use "Constructor function" to imitate the behaviour of using the keyword "class"

      the code we had before with out "Constructor Function) example:
      let house1 = {
          model: "Astoria",
          bedrooms: 3,
          guestRoom: true,
          finishedBasement: true,
          kitchen: 1,
          garage: 2,
          bathrooms: 2,
          flooring: "laminate"
      }
      */

        /*
          In PHP/Python:
          class House {
              // write the class members
          }
        
          In JS:
          Use function keyword with a "capitalized function name". 
          Put parameters in parenthesis and use them as arguments in function body.
          this function will act as boilerplate (template) to create the other object
  
          Notice here that "flooringType" has the value of "laminate" by default 
          */
        function House(modelName, bedRoomNum, hasGuestRoom, finishedBasement, kitchenNum, garageNum, bathRoomNum, flooringType = "Laminate") {
            // the code for assigning these values to the current object:
            // assigning these values to this object:
            // varName1 = modelName, varName2= bedRoomNum, and so on...

            // we can think about below are the properties:
            // we need to use the keyword "this" to inform JS that these list variables
            // are properties that belongs to this object

            // the variable on the left-hand side is the key (property) for this object
            // teh variable on the right-hand side is the value we are passing to this Constructor
            this.name = modelName;
            this.bedrooms = bedRoomNum;
            // we can use the same name for both: the property name and its value varaible:

        To summarize:
        There are some differences in syntax between
        - literal notation (oop1 examples)
        - and function constructor (this file oop2 examples)

        Literal notation uses double colons while constructor uses equals sign = for defining properties.
        Constructor function uses the "this" keyword which references the current object when adding data to it.
        Literal notation doesnâ€™t use "this" keyword for properties' keys.
