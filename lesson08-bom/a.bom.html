            Programming the Browser:

            - we can access the browser object in JS like the "window" object
            - The window object represents the browser's frame or window, in which your page is contained

            The collection of objects that the browser makes are called:
            - BOM ==> Browser Object Model

            since the first day, we've been using alert(), alert() is a method that belongs to the browser object:
            */

        alert("Here is my first message");
        // because alert() method that belongs to the browser object "window"
        window.alert("Here is my second message");

        /*
            We don't have to put the full code window.alert(), because the "window" object is a global object, which means you don't need to use its name to access its properties and method
        */

        // the same like:
        var firstName = window.prompt("Enter your first name:");

        var lastName = prompt("Enter your second name");

        window is one of the objects that belongs to the browser

        window as an object has:
        - properties: example ==> window.alert()

        Examples:
        window.alert();
