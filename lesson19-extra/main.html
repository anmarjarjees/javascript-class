        Modules in es6 (2015):
        Modules when we need to use different sections of code in another file
        1- Export the variables/function/classes.. from a JS file
        2- Then Import them in to another JS file

        In order to practice the idea of "modules",
        We need to have an active server running
        (like with PHP, when we use apache sever of XAMPP package)
        (Also like practising JSON API)

        NOTE:
        We cannot load the page directly from the folder and practicing modules,
        otherwise we will get something called "CORS POLICY" error
        as this requires a request that can work only with http which means having a server running

        We can use XAMPP or using a "Live Server" Extension in VS code (port: 5500)
        - XAMPP => refer to my PHP lectures
        - Live Server
