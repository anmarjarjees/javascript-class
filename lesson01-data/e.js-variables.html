        just for learning we will continue using internal js code:
        although in a real big project,
        we should create a new folder and save our js file
        that contains our js code in that folder as you will do in your final project

        We will keep using Internal JS code to focus on JS syntax
        Using script element to start coding our JavaScript within the HTML file:

        */

        // we need to officially declare the variable before start using it
        // we can declare a variable using using the keyword "var" or "let"
        // var variableName;
        var x;  // we are not giving x any data or value!

        // let's try to alert the variable x:
        // remember that x has no value
        alert(x); // "undefined" <=> The variable has been declared but with no value

        // notice the case below:
        alert(y); // y is not defined <=> Code ERROR: There is no such varaible "y"

        // after declaring a variable, we can start using it
        // x is already declared before, so we can just assign a value to it
        x = 1;
        alert(x); // 1

        // we can declare a variable, and give it a value at the same time (line)
        // this is called "initialize" the variable
        var y = 2; // let y=2
        alert(y); // 2


        // initialize "num1" variable (which is short for number) with the value of 100:
        /*
        var num1;
        num1=100;
        */
        // Or just in one step:
        var num1 = 100;

        // declare num2 variable first, and give it a value later:
        var num2;
        num2 = 200;

        // I need to find the total of these two variables num1 and num2:
        // and save the result into another variable named "total":
        var total = num1 + num2;
        alert(total);

        // we can even use the result variable to find the average
        var avg = total / 2;

        Task:
        Simple program to calculate the total price of my 4 textbooks.

        Assume you have 4 textbooks
        first book is $40.75
        second book is $72.45
        third book is $54.28
        fourth book is $57.31
        */

        // Part 1:
        // we can create/declare and initialize a new variable for each book
        // this variable will hold price of the book
        // declare and initialize variables "book1", "book2", "book3", and "book4" for example:

        // We are just assign a fixed value to each variable using our code
        // it's called "Hard Coding the values"
        var book1 = 40.75;
        var book2 = 72.45;
        var book3 = 54.28;
        var book4 = 57.31;

        // Part 2: Output the total of the four variables (books):

        // First Solution:
        // we can use alert to alert/show/display the total :
        alert(book1 + book2 + book3 + book4); // 224.79000000000002

        // Second Solution:
        // or we can create a variable named total or any name your prefer
        /*
        But if we need to save the total into a variable,
        in this case we need to create a new variable in the computer memory,
        this variable will be used to save the total of the 4 books

        Maybe we want to use another variable name to make it more meaningful
        to us as a programmer instead of just name it "total"

        For example: a name that contains three words => book price total

        Variable Naming Rules:
        1. No spaces, but we can use the underscore symbol: _
        2. We can't start with numbers
        3. We can't add special characters % ^ etc...

        In JS we have a naming convention that we should follow:
        is called "camelCase" ==> myFinalExam

        in other programming languages like C#:
        they have "PascalCase" ==> MyFinalExam

        in other programming languages like Python:
        they have "snake_case" ==> my_final_exam

         examples:
         a variable for full name => var fullName

         so please remember that it's just a naming convention for us as JS programmers
         all the following varaible names are Valid:
         - bookpricetotal
         - book_price_total
         - BookPriceTotal
         - The one we should use ==> bookPriceTotal (camelCase)


         var bookPriceTotal;
         bookPriceTotal = book1 + book2 + book3 + book4;
       */

        // Instead of using two lines, below is just one line
        // We can declare and initialize at the same time:
        var bookPriceTotal = book1 + book2 + book3 + book4;
        alert(bookPriceTotal); // 224.79000000000002

        /*
        Besides using alert() function to output data to the browser window,
        We can output data in to the console window by using another function (method) named console.log()
        */

        // instead of using alert, we can use: console.log() JS method (function)
        // the result will be seen ONLY inside the console window

        // To recap: you can use the hot keys (PC): CTRL+SHIFT+J or I or F12 ==> Console window
        console.log(bookPriceTotal); // 224.79000000000002

        // Yes, the number should be rounded

        /*
         Note: Remember that we, as programmers, use console.log to output our results,
         or testing our code only,
         but for the end user (our clients, customers) we can use the alert function for the time being. Later in the next chapters we will learn another more user friendly functions/tools to output/print the results on the page itself

        /*
        VERY IMPORTANT NOTES:
        The var keyword was since the beginning of JavaScript
        till 2015 when we had another keyword which is "let"
        After "let", "var" became one of the legacy code
     
        Why we should use "let" instead of "var" to declare a variable:
        JavaScript will not complaint
        about declaring the same variable more than one time using "var"
        but it will give us an error when declaring the same variable more than one time using "let"

        It's really not a good coding practice to declare the same variable two times
        mainly the same scope (later)

        And that's we can use the modern way to avoid this issue
        */
        var mySubject = "JavaScript";
        console.log(mySubject); // JavaScript

        var mySubject = "PHP";
        console.log(mySubject); // PHP


        let myProgram = "DMWD";
        console.log(myProgram); // DMWD
        // let myProgram = "FSSD";
        // Error: Identifier 'myProgram' has already been declared

        /*
        Besides the old way of using the keyword "var"
        and the new/modern way of using the keyword "let" instead
        we can use another modern way to declare a varaible which is "const" 

        const for "constant" which means this variable's value cannot be changed
        */
        const campus = "Toronto";

        // The following code will throw this error:
        // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
        campus = "Markham"; // ERROR

        /*
        Conclusion:
        - You can stop using the keyword "var" due to the main issue the we addressed above
        - Now "let" or "const", It's better to always use "const" for constant
        to declare any variable if you have no intention to change its value later, 
        or use let if the variable might have another value after being initialized 
        are after being assigned to another one.

        Variable Scopes: 
        Is a very important topic and depending on using var or let
        To be discussed with functions
