        we have style element to write our css and it has to be inside <head> element

        we can also put our styles in a different/separate file with the extension of .css
        and it's "External Styles"

        or we can add our styles to html elements as attributes,
        and it's called "Inline Styles"

        Any programming language must be converted to machine language (code) to be understood by the computer. So,
        some languages are interpreted into a machine code using an interpreter software, other languages are compiled
        into machine code using a complier software. JavaScript is an interpreted language rather than a compiled
        language. NOTE: JavaScript is NOT the script version of the Java language. Both are different languages, but the
        good news is that JavaScript is much easier to learn and use than Java

        We can use the console window in any browser
        to write our JS code:

        below are samples of what we have written in
        the console window:

        Notes:
        - To open the console window, we can use the hotkey "F12" in the browser window
        - Notice that "F12" is not for ALL the browser
        - We can make right click with any browser then inspect then console
        - We can clear the console window by just typing or using the function: clear()
        Link: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/clear

        NOTE:
        We can type the full syntax: console.clear() to fully clear console window output
        But since we are already writing our code inside the console window itself so we can just write clear()

        Please be advised that:
        - JavaScript is Case Sensitive so alert() is not like Alert()
        and it's not like ALERT()
        - Each line/statement in JS needs to be ended with ; (exactly like CSS rule)
        although it's optional to ignore/skip adding ; at the end
        but it's strongly recommended and good coding practice
