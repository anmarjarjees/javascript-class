    <!-- To write JS inside HTML file we use script element to write JavaScript -->

    <!--
    Note: In the old days (before HTML5), we used to add the attribute:
    "type="text/javascript"
    to specify that the scripting language is JavaScript,
    but with the HTML5 document no need to add this attribute.

    We used to have another scripting language from Microsoft
    named "Visual Basic Script or VB Script"
    but this language "VBS" was working only on Microsoft Internet Explorer Browser
    so it became obsolete sooner

    <script type="text/JavaScript">
    </script>

    W3 Validator will give us this WARNING:
    Warning: The type attribute is unnecessary for JavaScript resources.

    The 3 ways to run/execute a JS code:
    1- Writing our code inside our HTML file in between the script element
    Or
    2- Write our code in separate (external) js file with the extension of .js and attach/link this js file
    to our current HTML file (the same idea when we link the css file with our HTML page)
    3- Writing our code as inline code inside the html elements using the events attribute as we see later

    <script>
        /*
        Here is my comment in JavaScript
        it's a long comment that contains many lines:
        line 1
        line 2
        etc...
        */

        // We can write a short comment (1 line)
        // we only need these two symbols at the beginning
        // each line has a comment

        /*
        NOTE:
        like CSS we should end each statement (line) with ;
        although it's optional jn JS
        */
        alert("Hello JavaScript from the head section in my HTML page!");

        /*
        We used alert() => it's a built-in JS function (it comes with JS)

        later, we will learn how or own custom functions:
        for example: display()

        name() ==> function or method
        functionName()
        methodName()

        above and below we are using a JavaScript built-in function!!!
        built-in ==> native to JavaScript language itself

        example:
        alert() => is native/built-in function/method
        each function has to have "(" and ")"
        whether its empty or not we have to add them

        Please be advised that JavaScript is Case Sensitive
        so alert() is not like Alert()
        and it's not like ALERT()
        */
        alert("Hello JavaScript from the body section in my HTML page!");
        alert('I hope that you will like JavaScript!');
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- We can place our script anywhere inside the html file -->
    <script>
        // it has to be alert()
        // Alert("another test"); // error: Alert is not defined
        /*
            To check our JavaScript error we need to open the console window always
        */
        alert("Hello again from the body element");

        /*
        Although adding ";" at the end is optional
        but we should add ";" always for more clarification
        */
        alert(5 + 3); // 8
        alert(4 / 2); // 2
        alert(7 * 2); // 14
        alert(5 - 3); // 2

    </script>
</body>
<!--
    We can only place the script element inside the head or the body
    anywhere else, W3C Validator will give us this error:
    Error: Stray start tag script.
    Or:
    Error: script element between head and body.

    So we should not place the script element outside the body or outside the head

    Like the example below: Yes, it's working fine! but it's invalid HTML code
 -->
<script>
    alert("outside the body!!!");
</script>

</html>
