            Problem:
            - We need to keep asking (loop structure!) the user about his/her favourite sport

            - every time the user type a sport name,
            we want to add it (push it) into an array:

            - We need to continue asking the user till he/she types (enters): x or X

            - At end print the sport names list with unordered list
        */

        /*
        New concept: Null Value => JS keyword = "null"
        In JavaScript we can use the keyword "null" for nothing (no value)
        */

        /*
        Declare a varaible named "sport" to be used in our while loop
        just assign a temporary value of "null" because we don't know the user input yet!
        */
        var sport = null;

        // for testing:
        console.log(sport); // null

        // I want to keep asking the user to enter his favourite sports!
        // I want to stop my while when the user input "x" or "X"
        // So my while loop will stop when the value of name is "x" or "X"

        // I want to save the user input into an array:
        var sportList = []; // declare a new array to be used in our while loop
        var count = 1; // Notice that this counter has nothing to do with the loop
        while (sport != "x" && sport != "X") {

        REVIEW: isNaN()
        we can use isNaN():
        - isNaN(numeric) ==> returns false
        - isNaN(not numeric) ==> returns true

        Example:
        isNaN(5) ==> False because 5 is numeric value
        isNaN(xyz) ==> True because xyz is not numeric value

        We had to use while loop instead of for loop because we don't know how many times we will ask the user
        for loop, we have to specify the maximum limit to ask the user
        */


        // all the code below will be run after the user passing the while by entering a valid number:
        // we repeat exactly the same logic for the shopping list:
