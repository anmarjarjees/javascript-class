        // Task:
        /*
            Ask (prompt) the user to input a number between 1 and 10
            if the user input a valid number
            then using for-loop to find the result of this operation as explained below:

            For example:
            if the user inputs 5 (for example) => you need to find the total of:
            - 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = the total
            OR:
            - 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = the total

            if the user inputs 7 ==> 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = the result
            if the user inputs 3 ==> 3 + 2 + 1 = the result

            and so on for any number the user inputs

            But if the user inputs a number out of the range (1-10) => alert a warning message

            The logic:
            variable = ask the user to input a number
            If (this variable is greater/equal to 0 AND less/equal to 10)
                Then: do the operation of addition
            Else alert the user
        */

        var userNumber = parseInt(prompt("Enter any number between 1 and 10: "));  // for example: 4
        if (userNumber >= 1 && userNumber <= 10) {
            // We will write our main logic (the major code solutions)
            // for testing the if condition:
            // alert("Ok!");

            /*
                my code is to find the addition/total from 1 to 4
                1+2+3+4 Or 4+3+2+1
           
                Assuming 4-- => 3-- => 2-- => 1--

                 number = 4 and we have a container=0;
                 4+3+2+1
                 container = 0 + 4 = 4
                 container = 4 + 3 = 7
                 container = 7 + 2 = 9
                 container = 9 + 1 = 10

                 going descendencly from 4 to 1:
            */
            var count;
            var total = 0; // my cart when I shop online :-)
            for (count = userNumber; count >= 1; count--) {
                // for testing:
                // document.write("<br> " + count);

                // we can use the long way:
                // total = total + count; // +4 then +3 then +2 then +1 then stop!

                // or we can use the short way
                total += count; // instead of saying: total = total + count;
            }
            // we need to output the result AFTER (outside) the loop block
            document.write("<h2>The total is " + total + "</h2>");

            // Another way, we can change the logic of the for loop:
            // instead of going in this order: 4 + 3 + 2 + 1
            // we can start from 1 and stop with the user's number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
            // (4 + 3 + 2 + 1) is the same as (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)
            // Below we need to keep looping while the loopCounter is less than or equal to the user's number
            total = 0; // Just initialize the total variable with 0 (no need for var)
            for (count = 1; count <= userNumber; count++) {
                total = total + count;
                /*
                total = 0 + 4 ==> 4
                total = 4 + 3 ==> 7
                total = 7 + 2 ==> 9
                total = 9 + 1 ==> 10
                */
            } // end for loop
            // we need to output the result AFTER (outside) the loop block
            document.write("<h2>The total again is: " + total + "</h2>");
        } else {
            alert("Invalid Input!");
